    - cve: CVE-2024-28115
      reason: Affects only ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with Memory Protected
        Unit (MPU) support enabled
    - cve: CVE-2021-43997
      reason: This vulnerability only affects ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M ports of FreeRTOS
        and hence does not affect Espressif SoCs which are not based on these architectures.
    - cve: CVE-2021-32020
      reason: This vulnerability only affects native FreeRTOS heap allocation schemes
        and ESP-IDF uses its own scheme for dynamic memory management.
    - cve: CVE-2021-31571
      reason: The fix for this vulnerability has been incorporated in the FreeRTOS
        kernel being used in ESP-IDF v4.3. For details, refer https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/AR2021-005%20Security%20Advisory%20on%20BadAlloc%20Vulnerabilities.pdf.
