# ESP-IDF SBOM Tool (**esp-idf-sbom**)

> :warning: **This is experimental implementation, which is subject to change without prior
> notice and no backward compatibility is guaranteed.**

The esp-idf-sbom tool creates [Software bill of materials][1] (SBOM)
files in the [Software Package Data Exchange][2] (SPDX) format for applications
generated by the [Espressif IoT Development Framework][3] (ESP-IDF).
It also allows to check generated SBOM files for know vulnerabilities against
the [National Vulnerability Database][4] (NVD) based on the
[Common Platform Enumeration][5] (CPE) provided in the SBOM.


## SPDX SBOM layout

The SBOM file is created based on application sources, build artefacts, information
provided by the ESP-IDF build system and SBOM manifest files. The resulting SBOM
file contains SPDX packages for the final **project** application, used **toolchain**,
**components** used during build and git **submodules**. Packages are linked
together with SPDX *DEPENDS_ON* relationships with the **project** package as the root
package. By default packages for configuration only components and components not
linked into the application are present in SBOM, but are not linked through SPDX
relationships. In other worlds dependencies on such packages are removed. This behaviour
can be altered with `--add-config-deps` and `--add-unused-deps` command line options.


## Manifest file

During SBOM generation the esp-idf-sbom tool is looking for `sbom.yml` manifest files.
The manifest file may be present at root of **project**, **component** or **submodule**.
It is used as a source of information for the corresponding SPDX package in the SBOM file
as described above.

It's a simple yaml file, which may contain the following entries.

* **version**:
    Package version.
* **description**:
    Short package description.
* **repository**:
    Link to git repository.
* **url**:
    Link to package download location.
* **cpe**:
    CPE used for vulnerabilities check against NVD.
* **supplier**:
    Package supplier. Person or organization distributing the package. Should be prefixed
    with *Person:* or *Organization:* as described in SPDX specification.
* **originator**:
    Package originator. If the package comes from another person or organization
    that has been identified as a supplier. For example if a component is based
    on 3rd party code with some modifications, the originator is the 3rd party code
    author, but the supplier is the person or organization distributing the final
    component. For more detailed information please see the SPDX specification.
    As for supplier, *Person:* or *Organization:* prefix should be used for
    originator value.

Example of the `sbom.yml` manifest file for the ESP-IDF blink example.

```
version: 0.1.0
description: Blink application example
url: https://blink.org/blink-0.1.0.tar.gz # non-existing package download URL example
cpe: cpe:2.3:a:hrbata:blink:{}:*:*:*:*:*:*:* # non-existing CPE example
supplier: 'Person: Frantisek Hrbata (frantisek.hrbata@espressif.com)'
originator: 'Organization: Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD'
```

Example of the `sbom.yml` manifest file for the blink's main component.

```
version: 0.1.0
description: Main component for blink application
repository: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git@dc016f59877d13e6e7d4fc193aa5aa764547f16d#examples/get-started/blink
supplier: 'Organization: Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD'
```

Information from the `sbom.yml` file are mapped to the following SPDX tags.

| manifest     | SPDX                         |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| version      | PackageVersion               |
| description  | PackageSummary               |
| repository   | ExternalRef OTHER repository |
| url          | PackageDownloadLocation      |
| cpe          | ExternalRef cpe23Type        |
| supplier     | PackageSupplier              |
| originator   | PackageOriginator            |

Even though the `sbom.yml` file is the primary source of information, the esp-idf-sbom tool
is also looking at other places if it's not present. The version, description and url
information from the `idf_component.yml` manifest file is used for components managed by
the component manager. Component version may be guessed based on git-describe and Espressif
as a default supplier may be guessed based on git repository or package URL. The guessing
may be dissabled by using the '--no-guess' option. For submodules, the .gitmodules file is
also checked for additional submodule information.


## Installation

Currently esp-idf-sbom is not integrated into ESP-IDF and needs to by installed
separately from Python Package Index (PyPI) with

    pip install esp-idf-sbom

After installation the `esp-idf-sbom` command should be available or the esp_idf_sbom
python module can be used with

    python -m esp_idf_sbom


## Creating SBOM

The application has to be built before the SBOM file can be created. This step should
not be required in the future once esp-idf-sbom is integrated into ESP-IDF.

The SBOM file can be created with

    esp-idf-sbom create <project description file>

The `project description file` is a path to the *project_description.json* file, which
is by default created by the ESP-IDF build system in the project's *build* directory.
The generated SBOM file is printed to the standard output stream by default or can be
saved in a file if the `--output-file` option is used.


## Checking vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are checked based on the [Common Platform Enumeration][5] (CPE) information
included in the SBOM file for SPDX packages. While checking for vulnerabilities, only packages
with direct or indirect relationship to the **project** package are examined. For example if mbedtls
component is compiled, due to component dependecies, but it's actually not linked into the
final binary, it will be by default presented in the SBOM file, but it will not be reachable
from the root **project** package and hence it will not be checked for vulnerabilities.
The reason for this is to avoid possible false possitives, because such packages
have no direct impact on the resulting application. This can be changed with the `--all`
option. If used, all packages in the SBOM file will be checked for possible vulnerabilities
regardless their relationships to the application binary.

SBOM file generated by the esp-idf-sbom tool can be checked for known vulnerabilities
with

    esp-idf-sbom check [SBOM file]

If *SBOM file* is not provided, the stardard input stream is used.


## Usage example

This is an example of basic usage for the blink project, which is part of the ESP-IDF. The
two `sbom.yml` files for project and main component showed above were added. It's expected
that ESP-IDF is installed and set.

```
$ cd examples/get-started/blink/ # In esp-idf directory go to the blink example
$ idf.py build                   # Project has to be built first
$ esp-idf-sbom create -o blink.spdx build/project_description.json
$ esp-idf-sbom check blink.spdx
```

```
$ esp-idf-sbom create build/project_description.json | esp-idf-sbom check
```

The resulting `blink.spdx` sbom file can be found in the `examples` directory.
